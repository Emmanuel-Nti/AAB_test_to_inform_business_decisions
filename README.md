| I work at a startup that sells food products. I need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. I would first study the sales funnel; find out how users reach the purchase stage, how many users actually make it to this stage? how many get stuck at previous stages? which stages in particular? I would then conduct an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. | *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *matplotlib.pyplot*, *scipy*, *plotly*, *seaborn*, "numpy*, *math* | Practicum by Yandex |
